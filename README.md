Roblox Forum Enhancer
=====================
This is the source code of the [Roblox Forum Enhancer] google chrome extension.

Features
--------
 * Removes ads from the sidebar and header, giving more space for the forum posts
 * Changes the page title to the format `A Thread | The subforum | Roblox Forums`
 * New forum submenu
     - Promotes the "breadcrumb" to large visible chevron list
     - Contains the "My forums" and "Profile" buttons
     - Search box
     - Shortcut to extension settings
 * Post timestamps in your time zone
     - Displayed as "5 minutes ago", "yesterday", etc
     - Hover over with mouse to see full date and time
 * Reply button behaviour is fixed, so that it now actually replies to the post you click on.
 * [Markdown] support in forum posts
 * Infinite scrolling of paged threads - hit the bottom of one page, the next loads!

> WARNING: The Forum Enhancer is not produced or endorsed by Roblox. Normal forum rules still apply. What you type in the textarea is what is posted in the forums. If you break the rules, this is not my problem.

Terms of use
------------
 * You may not upload any derivatives or copies of this software, that change
   the behaviour and/or appearance of the roblox forums, as an extension on the
   chrome web store. There should only be one "Roblox Forum Enhancer". You may
   however create a similar "[some forum] Forum Enhancer", for example, using
   this code, under no such restrictions.

 * **You may port this code into a Roblox Forum Enhancer extension for another
   browser**, providing that the markdown dialect used is identical to the one
   used here. This is to try and ensure consistency between browsers. Markdown
   was picked intentionally for its readability without any rich formatting.
